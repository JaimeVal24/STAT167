* **3. Which airlines have the most delays?**
    * **Plan:** Compare the typical delay experience across different carriers.
    * **Methods:** Create boxplots of `dep_delay` by `carrier`. We can sort the boxplots by median in order to produce a ranking of airlines by their median delay. 
    * **Objective:** To identify which airlines are consistently late regardless of other factors.
